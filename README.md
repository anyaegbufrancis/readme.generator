  ## Description  
  
  This project attempts to optimize the developer's time by directing time to actual development tasks like post project clean up, as-built documentation and operational instruction is take care of by in automated and interactive way to generating a clean, consistent and professional README.md file. It can be easily edited to reflect further customization and align better with project specifics. Every input is validated to ensure that the data is accurate and take care of minor errors.

At the end of the program the user is presented their input before it is finally written to a README.md file in /output directory.
